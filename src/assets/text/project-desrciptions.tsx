export const PortfolioWebSiteDescription =
  "This site was created using the React.js framework with TypeScript. I had learned React back in university to develop a social media website with a small team but haven't touched it since. Part of the reason for developing this portfolio was to relearn the framework and get a better appreciation of it now that itâ€™s no longer tied to just a dreaded school project. And that mission was successful as I had a lot of fun creating Components to work as I envisioned them and figuring out what Hooks to use to overcome some challenges with the design of this site. This was a fun project and I'm satisfied with the finished product.";

export const TextEditorDescription =
  "This was a school project I made to simulate a simple text editor like Notepad. With this app, the user can open, create, edit and save text files in their file system. The program also has a spell checker that reads a separate text file containing a list of words to create a dictionary data structure and uses that dictionary to search for possible misspellings in the document. I choose to highlight this project as it encapsulated everything I enjoy about software engineering: taking an idea and giving it form through design-planning, coming up with solutions to complex problems, and watching magic happen when it all comes together.
